# TADPOLE-Valve-Control-Model
Here you can find the Simulink and MATLAB Code for the Closed Loop Control of TADPOLE's valves

If you have any questions, DM me on Slack: @pabloplataa

Next steps would involve using data from water flow tests and/or future static testing to create more accurate plant dynamics and noise/error models
